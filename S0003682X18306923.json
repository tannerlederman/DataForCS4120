    "abstract": "The auditory and non-auditory effects of noise on health are today well known. A number of studies have recently shown that cyclists represent a population that is especially strongly exposed to noise in urban environments, particularly because of their proximity to road traffic. These studies have however very rarely examined the case of the cities of the South, despite the fact that these cities are known to have higher levels of exposure to noise. The objective of this article is therefore to analyze variations in cyclists\u2019 levels of noise exposure in Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam) by integrating three dimensions: that is, the characteristics of the trip, neighbourhood effects, and the temporal dimension. Three participants cycled more than 1000 km in the city, equipped with noise dosimeters and GPS watches, for a total of 3300 one-minute segments, each of which measured noise intensity (LAeq dB(A)). It is not surprising that the levels of exposure registered were particularly high (average 78.8 dB(A)), notably compared with earlier studies conducted in Europe and North America. The use of generalized additive models in particular made it possible to highlight the effect of the complex interaction between the slope and the cyclists\u2019 speed on the levels of noise exposure, the effect and duration of the morning and afternoon rush hour periods, and the spatial distribution of residual environmental noise. One of the main findings was that in sectors with the highest levels of exposure to noise (central neighbourhoods or areas near the airport), these levels are up to four times higher than in more peripheral or rural areas.",
